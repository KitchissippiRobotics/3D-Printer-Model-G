# 3D-Printer-Model-G

A large style RepRap printer, highly influenced by the Prusa i3, RepRap Wilson2 and LulzBot Taz printer designs. 12mm diameter rods will be used for the X and Z axis. The Y axis will run on a pair of 9mm rails bolted directly to t-slot extrusions. The goal is to be able to mount a 300mm x 300mm print bed with a standard MKII 24v heater using aluminum to help spread the heat more evenly across the larger glass tile. Y carriage will likely use 1/4" thick MDF to provide a stiff platform on which to mount the bed. Belt drives for X and Y axis will use common GT2 belts and drive pulleys.

A combination of Sketchup and OpenSCAD are utilized for part design with a final assembly mock up in Sketchup.
